## Clustering


clustering is a intermediate step. See project documentation

| QMD | Description|
|----|----|
|clustering | Exploration at clustering alternatives - Settled on MFA+HDBSCAN, created clusters |
|cluster_classifier | Retro-fit clusters into classification models - first attempt |
|**cluster_classifier_redux** | Random Forest and rpart classifier with reduced set of attributes (based on importance in previous notebook)|
| cluster_classifier_redux_2 | Alternative selection of attributes/partitions|
|cluster_classifier_composite| Alternative approach, using simple formula for cluster 1, then random forest for 0/2 classification|

**cluster_classifier_redux contains the chosen model **
