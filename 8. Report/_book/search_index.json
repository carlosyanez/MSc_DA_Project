Through this process it is possible to illustrate the model’s strength and shortcomings at capturing how demographic factors succeed and fail to capture the change in voting patterns. This exercise uses the results from the 2021 Census of Population and Housing. The base voting percentages are taken from the last Newspoll prior to the election (Benson 2023) . Newspoll is usually considered a good predictor of the Australian election. The values are shown in table 6.1. Please note these values are national - but since there is no data at cluster level these are anyway. .cl-15d05ca8{}.cl-15ba110a{font-family:'Arial';font-size:11pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);background-color:transparent;}.cl-15c4a232{margin:0;text-align:left;border-bottom: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);padding-bottom:5pt;padding-top:5pt;padding-left:5pt;padding-right:5pt;line-height: 1;background-color:transparent;}.cl-15c4d892{width:0.701in;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: middle;border-bottom: 1.5pt solid rgba(102, 102, 102, 1.00);border-top: 1.5pt solid rgba(102, 102, 102, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.cl-15c4d89c{width:0.88in;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: middle;border-bottom: 1.5pt solid rgba(102, 102, 102, 1.00);border-top: 1.5pt solid rgba(102, 102, 102, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.cl-15c4d8a6{width:0.701in;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: middle;border-bottom: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.cl-15c4d8b0{width:0.88in;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: middle;border-bottom: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.cl-15c4d8ba{width:0.701in;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: middle;border-bottom: 1.5pt solid rgba(102, 102, 102, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.cl-15c4d8c4{width:0.88in;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: middle;border-bottom: 1.5pt solid rgba(102, 102, 102, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;} Table 6.1: Newspoll Primary Vote Forecast, 20 May 2022 PartyForecastCOAL35%ALP36%GRN12%Other17% The first step in the forecasting process is to map the electorates into the 3 clusters. The result is presented in figure 6.1. Figure 6.1: Cluster in 2022 Election After clustering, the regression models have been used to calculate a predicted outcome. Results have been transformed back to absolute values and then compared against actual results. This is presented in figure 6.2. The RMSE values are presened in table 6.2.

However, it can be used as a tool to analyse the vote dynamics. 6.2 The Teal Wave A particular phenomenon of the last election consisted in the so called “Teal Wave”, where centrist independents campaigned in traditional Coalition electorates. Most of these electorates are located in inner city, wealthy areas of Melbourne and Sydney, where voters have consistently voted Coalition since the Australian Federation. Right leaning voters in these areas are perceived as moderate, socially liberal (“little-l liberals”) who were dissatisfied with a perceived conservative turn in Coalition politics. Teal candidates managed to unseat incumbent MPs - did they in effect capture the dissatisfied Coalition base? The results and predictions for 4 cases are presented in figure 6.3. Figure 6.3: Example 1: Teal Wave The answer is this case seems to indicate that dwindling Coalition vote is not entirely related to a new teal offering. Observing figure 6.4, demographic changes in figure Liberal (Coalition) voting decline aligns with increase in higher income population and secular views - trend that predates the emergence of the teal movement. Thus, it is valid to assume that these new candidates growth is largely attributable to the same growing group of people that voted Green in the past, plus Labor voters. Figure 6.4: Selected demographics for teal seats 6.3 The Green Wave Another feature of the past election was the increase in the number of Green Party MPs. In addition to the division of Melbourne, green candidates also won the seats of Griffith and Ryan in Brisbane. Again, do these victories have a demographic driver? Are there any differences between these electorates and contigous divisions, and between them and other electorates where the Green have been strong contender? 6.5 shows the prediction the latest and historic election results. figure 6.6 presents selected demographic attributes for those areas. Figure 6.5: Green Voting Figure 6.6: Demographics in Green seats From the carts, three is clear correlation between demographic attributes and primary vote. This is clear for Griffith and Ryan, but also for Brisbane - where Greens didn’t win the seat. In wills, this effect is more difficult to visually inspect in Wills, however actual results lies very closed to the predictions. 6.4 The Changing face of suburbia For a comparison outside inner city areas, lets compare four suburban electorates: Hasluck (Perth), Menzies (Melbourne), Fowler (Sydney) and Kingston (Adelaide). Their respective predictions and results are presented in figure 6.7.
