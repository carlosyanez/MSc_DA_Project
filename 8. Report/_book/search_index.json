The intent behind this is to leverage the trained model to identify the main contributors to the classification. Different models where tried, starting with a basic tree partitioning. After trial and error, random forest was the chosen algorithm. The model training with: Census data from 2007 to 2016 (mirroring elections between 2006 to 2016) was used from training and testing. Values for demographic attributes where centred around the overall percentage for said attribute, for the respective cluster. clusters previously obtained with HDBSCAN were used as the response. Since year has been “discounted”, all values will considered one pool to divide, i.e. year will be ignored. An assumption has been made that the period in question is short enough to drastically affect the clustering model. If demographic values change - cluster assignment (for instance because of re-distribution), the effect is similar to being a different electorate. The initial fitting produces the results presented in table XXX "]]
