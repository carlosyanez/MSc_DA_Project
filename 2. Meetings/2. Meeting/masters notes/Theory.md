BEHIND SCHEDULE 

- One paper (australian focused), suggested probit model for primary vote analysis - no maths provided on the paper.
- People also using decission tree models

Thinking of cluster first and then run a GLM on clustered data. (to account for different models)?
- Perhaps use a state-wide, group-wide recommender system?
- 

- Australian election study looking at main factor to analysis.
--- Conventional knowledge (an reseach) indicates people become more conservative with age .  Australian election study shows voting patterns may be different from generation to generation (e.g. millenials NOT becoming more conservative)
--- Second factor education
--- Third factor income/wealth - not 100% correlated to education - wealthy tradies, housing bubble

Are the any differences between geographical diverse vs geographical homogenous electorates?

--- climate events as general (i.e. not as much as local as communicated with the press may be correlated with education)
